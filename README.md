## Brief explanation of codes

This repository is divided into 3 sections:
1. **Lane detection:** Contains work related to driving lane detection only.
2. **YOLOv4-tiny training:** Contains work related to traffic signs and signals detection and recognition using YOLO.
3. **Tensorflow YOLOv4 with lane detection:** Contains final work where the above two things are merged into a single system with Tensorflow framework.

### Lane detection:
